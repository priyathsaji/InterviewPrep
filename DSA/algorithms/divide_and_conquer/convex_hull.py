Convex Hull Algorithm (Divide and Conquer)

The Convex Hull algorithm finds the smallest convex polygon that contains all the given points. The divide and conquer
approach splits the points into two halves, finds the convex hull of each half, and then merges them.

Time Complexity:
- Best: O(n log n) where n is the number of points
- Average: O(n log n)
- Worst: O(n log n)

Space Complexity:
- O(n) for storing points and the hull

Characteristics:
1. More efficient than Graham scan for large datasets
2. Works in any dimension (2D, 3D, etc.)
3. Can handle collinear points
4. Can be modified to find k-hull
5. Can be extended to find convex hull with different metrics
