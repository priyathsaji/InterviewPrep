Skyline Problem Algorithm

The Skyline Problem is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that finds the outline of buildings when viewed from a distance.
Given the coordinates of buildings (left, height, right), it returns the key points that form the skyline.

Time Complexity:
- Best: O(n log n) where n is the number of buildings
- Average: O(n log n)
- Worst: O(n log n)

Space Complexity:
- O(n) for storing buildings and the skyline

Characteristics:
1. More efficient than brute force approach
2. Can handle overlapping buildings
3. Can be extended to 3D skyline
4. Can handle buildings with different heights
5. Can be modified to find skyline with different metrics
