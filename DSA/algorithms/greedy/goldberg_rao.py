Goldberg-Rao Algorithm for Maximum Flow

The Goldberg-Rao Algorithm is an efficient algorithm for computing the maximum flow in a flow network.
It uses a push-relabel approach with dynamic trees and is particularly efficient for sparse graphs.

Time Complexity:
- Best: O(VE log(V^2/E)) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
- Average: O(VE log(V^2/E))
- Worst: O(VE log(V^2/E))

Space Complexity:
- O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges

Characteristics:
1. Uses push-relabel approach
2. Implements dynamic trees
3. Works well with sparse graphs
4. Works with directed graphs
5. Can handle multiple sources and sinks
