Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array nums. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which gets added to the player's score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner.

Input Format:
- nums: List[int] - Array of integers

Output Format:
- bool - True if Player 1 can win, False otherwise

Example:
Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: False
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.

Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]
Output: True
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233. Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.

Constraints:
- 1 <= len(nums) <= 20
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^7

Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the length of nums
Space Complexity: O(n^2)
